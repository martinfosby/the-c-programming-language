* main.c
This is where i execute my main program.
stdio.h is a library for input and output functions
the arguments inside of main are the arguments this program takes inside the os such as linux
printf which means print formated is how we output formated text to the standard output
return 0 means that the program succeded so the os knows theres nothing wrong.
